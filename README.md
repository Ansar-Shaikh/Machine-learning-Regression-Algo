Simple Linear Regression
This repository contains an implementation of Simple Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning technique used for predictive modeling. The model establishes a linear relationship between an independent variable (e.g., CGPA) and a dependent variable (e.g., Salary Package).

Overview
Equation: 
𝑦=𝑚𝑥+𝑐
y=mx+c
Independent Variable (X): CGPA
Dependent Variable (Y): Package (Salary)
Goal: Predict the output variable (Y) based on the input variable (X) using a best-fit line.
